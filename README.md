# RummyPlusPlus

An unofficial recreation of the Five Crowns¬Æ card game built using tape and popsicle sticks (RatchetPHP and jQuery) for my mother.

Current progress can be viewed at https://beta.rummyplusplus.com

To-Do:
- Overhaul gameplay loop to allow easier implementation of...(see next item)
- Multiplayer. That was the original goal. The bots were supposed to just be for testing, but I've spent a disproportionate amount of time on them for what my actual goals are.
- The bot algorithms are bad; like discarding wildcards bad. I just need to sit down and revist it. Probably build from scratch.
- Just an overall refactor. It's a little bit üçù
- Card design doesn't always scale nicely. Should probably move to having pre-baked SVGs that scale to the card size. But honestly, I'm actually kind of proud of the hellishly convoluted method to get it where it is with just tailwind.
